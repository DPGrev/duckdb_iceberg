# Spark doesnt properly support local timezones, so the parquet files it produces will always have isAdjustedToUTC set to true,
# and thus be interpreted as timezoned, check out: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35662
# Im not sure but are we handling the impala timestamps correctly? we currently view them as non-timezoned, but i kindof
# think they should be timezoned? Needs more readin.
